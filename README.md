# Spotifeed

Spotifeed aims to offer an easy-to-navigate platform which will make use of Spotify's WebAPI to provide better information about your followed artists.
It will show their newest albums and singles in a scrollable feed and also add to Spotify's current suggested artists functionality. 

In order to run this project you will need to clone and run https://github.com/charliemike3124/SpotiFeedAuth this project as well. SpotiFeedAuth allows you 
to authenticate your account with Spotify, both projects will need to be running in order for it to work. 

## Run server

Open a terminal on the root folder and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. If SpotiFeedAuth is not running as well you wont be
able to authenticate your Spotify account. 


The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
